This document outlines various exercises and challenges focused on data structures, particularly emphasizing string manipulation, array operations, and sequence analysis. Each item represents a specific problem that helps in understanding and applying data structure concepts in practical scenarios.

## String Manipulation and Array Challenges

### String Challenges

1. **1768. Merge Strings Alternately**: Combine two strings by alternatingly taking characters from each.
2. **1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings**: Find the largest string that can be made such that it can be repeatedly added to itself to get both the input strings.
3. **1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies**: Determine which kids can have the greatest number of candies after giving extra candies to them.
4. **605. Can Place Flowers**: Check if a given number of flowers can be planted without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.
5. **345. Reverse Vowels of a String**: Reverse only the vowels in a string.
6. **151. Reverse Words in a String**: Reverse the order of words in a given string, where words are separated by one or more spaces.

### Array Challenges

7. **238. Product of Array Except Self**: Compute an array where each element is the product of all numbers in the array except the number at that index, without using division.
8. **334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence**: Determine if there exists a triplet of indices such that the corresponding values are in increasing order, not necessarily contiguous.
9. **443. String Compression**: Compress a string using the counts of repeated characters and return the new length of the compressed string.
